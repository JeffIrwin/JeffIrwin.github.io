# The ffmpeg manifesto

## Creating a blurred overlay

### 2023 Oct 29

We believe video editing software should be free and open without freemium
limits on resolution.

We believe GUIs are bloatware which do not lend themselves to reusable
scriptable workflows.

We believe CLIs are the ideal type of interface.

Just kidding, I'm not going to write a whole blog post in this style.

## The gargantuan one-liner

Let's say you want to take a widescreen video in `16:9` aspect ratio and post it
somewhere like [TikTok](www.tiktok.com) or Reels.  The only problem is that
those are mobile-friendly vertical video platforms, so a widescreen video isn't
ideal.  Instead of a short fat widescreen video, you need a tall skinny vertical
video.

One common hack is to overlay the original widescreen video centered overtop of
a blurred and cropped background in the correct vertical aspect ratio, `9:16`
instead of `16:9`.  Here's what that looks like with some content from [Fallout
4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4):

| ![](resources/ffmpeg-input.png) | ![](resources/ffmpeg-output.png) |
| Figure 1a: `16:9` input | Figure 1b: blurred overlay `9:16` output |

You can do this with a single gargantuan one-liner [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) command:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg \
	-i "input.mp4" \
	-vf "split [fg][bg];
	[bg]        crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih, boxblur=30 [bg];
	[fg]       scale=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ceil(ih*9*9/16/16/2)*2 [fg];
	[bg][fg] overlay=y=main_h/2-overlay_h/2" \
	"output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

We'll break this down step by step below.

## The deceptive allure of ffmpeg

`ffmpeg` is intimidating.  You get lured in with straightforward conversion
commands with just a couple arguments, e.g. `avi` to `mp4`:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.avi" "output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

And then there are moderately more advanced commands to apply video filters,
e.g. scaling an input resolution down or up to HD resolution `1920:1080`:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -filter:video "scale=1920:1080" "output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

And finally there are gargantuan one-liners like ours, similar to what you might
find on [stack](https://stackoverflow.com/q/53795205)
[overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19300561)
[posts](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61360675) from `ffmpeg` wizards.

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg \
	-i "input.mp4" \
	-vf "split [fg][bg];
	[bg]        crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih, boxblur=30 [bg];
	[fg]       scale=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ceil(ih*9*9/16/16/2)*2 [fg];
	[bg][fg] overlay=y=main_h/2-overlay_h/2" \
	"output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

How does anyone come up with these?  What seemed like a problem of crafting a
few command line arguments has evolved into a task of writing a weird
interpretted programming language, complete with variables like `[fg]` and
`[bg]`, mathematical operations and the `ceil()` function, and bizarrely
abbreviated constant variables like `ih` and `main_h`.

But before we dive into the complexity, let's help you help yourself with
`ffmpeg`.

## Getting help with ffmpeg

To get top-level help, use `ffmpeg --help` or `ffmpeg -h`:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -h

# Hyper fast Audio and Video encoder
# usage: ffmpeg [options] [[infile options] -i infile]... {[outfile options] outfile}...
# 
# Getting help:
#     -h      -- print basic options
#     -h long -- print more options
# 
# Video options:
# -vframes number     set the number of video frames to output
# -r rate             set frame rate (Hz value, fraction or abbreviation)
# -s size             set frame size (WxH or abbreviation)
# -vf filter_graph    set video filters
{% endhighlight %}

There's a long verbose banner with version and build info before the actual help
starts, and a lot of other "basic" options which I've omitted.  For someone used
to keyword arguments which don't depend on position, it can be confusing that
there are separate `[infile options]` and `[outfile options]` which *do* depend
on where they are positioned in the argument list.

To get help with filters, use `ffmpeg -filters`:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -filters

# Filters:
#   T.. = Timeline support
#   .S. = Slice threading
#   ..C = Command support
#   A = Audio input/output
#   V = Video input/output
#   N = Dynamic number and/or type of input/output
#   | = Source or sink filter
#  T.. boxblur           V->V       Blur the input.
#  ..C crop              V->V       Crop the input video.
#  TSC overlay           VV->V      Overlay a video source on top of the input.
#  ..C scale             V->V       Scale the input video size and/or convert the image format.
{% endhighlight %}

It feels inconsistent, but notice there's no `-h` in the above help command for
filters. Again, I've omitted everything that's irrelevant to this blog.

Note that most of these filters map a single video input to a single video
output `V->V`.  The exception is `overlay`, which maps two inputs to one output
`VV->V`.

Finally, to get help with a specific filter, e.g. `crop`, use `ffmpeg -h filter=crop`:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -h filter=crop

# Filter crop
#   Crop the input video.
#     Inputs:
#        #0: default (video)
#     Outputs:
#        #0: default (video)
# crop AVOptions:
#   out_w             <string>     ..FV..... set the width crop area expression (default "iw")
#   w                 <string>     ..FV..... set the width crop area expression (default "iw")
#   out_h             <string>     ..FV..... set the height crop area expression (default "ih")
#   h                 <string>     ..FV..... set the height crop area expression (default "ih")
#   x                 <string>     ..FV..... set the x crop area expression (default "(in_w-out_w)/2")
#   y                 <string>     ..FV..... set the y crop area expression (default "(in_h-out_h)/2")
#   keep_aspect       <boolean>    ..FV..... keep aspect ratio (default false)
#   exact             <boolean>    ..FV..... do exact cropping (default false)
{% endhighlight %}

The [online ffmpeg help](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html) can be better
at providing examples for filters like this.  Putting all the help together,
here's an example crop command:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -filter "crop=608:1080" "crop.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

This crops the input to a width of 608 and a height of 1080.

## Breaking down the one-liner

I'll be honest, it took me a couple hours of trial and error to settle on this
one-liner.  I started step by step with a workflow that used 4 separate
commands:

1. Crop the background to a vertical aspect ratio
2. Blur the background
3. Scale the foreground down to match the background's width
4. Overlay the foreground onto the background

Let's first translate those steps in the most straightforward way to `ffmpeg`
commands, trading elegance for simplicity.  We'll get it working before we get
it working elegantly, efficiently, and generally.

### Fixed 1920:1080 resolution

Here are those steps translated into `ffmpeg` commands, assuming the input has
dimensions `1920:1080`:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -vf "crop=608:1080" "crop.mp4"
ffmpeg -i  "crop.mp4" -vf "boxblur=30" "blur.mp4"
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -vf "scale=608:342" "scale.mp4"
ffmpeg -i "blur.mp4" -i "scale.mp4" -filter_complex "overlay=y=369" "output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

The short option `-vf` is an alias of the long options `-filter`, `-filter:v`,
or `-filter:video`.  Why specify `video`?  Because `ffmpeg` can filter audio
too!

Every video filter has arguments.  For example, the `crop` filter takes `width`
and `height` arguments with the syntax `crop=width:height`, e.g.
`crop=608:1080`.  This filter takes the `1920:1080` input (`16:9` aspect) and
crops to the middle `608:1080` (`9:16` aspect).  The `crop` filter has other
optional arguments listed in the help above that can crop other areas besides
the middle.  We'll figure out how to generalize this to other input dimensions
with the same aspect ratio below.

The `boxblur` filter has an argument to control the blurriness.

The `scale` filter downsizes the input to `608:342`, the same width as the
crop (`608`) with the original `16:9` aspect ratio.

Finally, the `overlay` filter lays the scaled video over the middle of the
blurred video, at a vertical `y` position `369`.  We have to do a little math to
figure out the middle position.  Here it is half the blur height minus half the
overlay height, i.e. `0.5 * 1080 - 0.5 * 342 = 369`.  If you're worried about
whether `y` is measured from the top or from the bottom, it doesn't matter.

### General 16:9 aspect ratio

Instead of hard-coding dimensions for a `1920:1080` input, these can be
generalized to work with any `16:9` aspect ratio, e.g. `1280:720`, HD
`1920:1080`, 4K `3840:2160`, etc.

This can be achieved by using the named variables accepted by many filters in
`ffmpeg`, e.g. `ih` for the height of the input frame.  I might call these
constants, as they don't really change on the fly and they're distinct from
*labels* which we'll get to later, but `ffmpeg` calls them variables anyway
instead of constants.

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -vf "crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih" "crop.mp4"

ffmpeg -i "crop.mp4" -vf "boxblur=30" "blur.mp4"

ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" \
	-vf "scale=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ceil(ih*9*9/16/16/2)*2" \
	"scale.mp4"

ffmpeg -i "blur.mp4" -i "scale.mp4" \
	-filter_complex "overlay=y=main_h/2-overlay_h/2" "output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

Many filters accept `ih` for the input height and `iw` for the input width.  The
`overlay` filter is slightly more complicated because there are two inputs and
thus two heights: `main_h` and `overlay_h`.  If you get the main and overlay
inputs mixed up like I do, just remember that the *overlay* input gets layed *over*
the main input.

I should explain the [funny `ceil()`
function](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20848224) in the `crop` and `scale`
filters, e.g. `crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih`.  Ideally we would want a cropped
width of just `ih*9/16`, but some formats and codecs will error out if you try
to use an odd numbered dimension.  To guarantee an even number, we can divide by
2, round up, and multiply by 2 again, hence `ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2`.  The `scale`
filter is similar.

Further generalization to other aspect ratio inputs and outputs like `4:3` is
left as an exercise for the reader.

## Chaining steps together into a filtergraph

The workflow above leaves a few temporary files `crop.mp4`, `blur.mp4`, and
`scale.mp4` which can be cleaned up.  The gargantuan one-liner is better because
it does not waste any time reading, writing, and transcoding temporary files.
In a benchmark that I ran, the whole process takes 1m57s as four separate
commands but just 0m44s as a one-liner.  If you want the details of that
benchmark, the input video was a 1 minute long, 60 fps, `1920:1080`, 20 MB `mp4`
file.

Again, take things one step at a time when chaining together these gargantuan
one-liners.  To start, the first two steps of cropping and blurring can be
combined:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -vf "crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih" "crop.mp4"
ffmpeg -i "crop.mp4" -vf "boxblur=30" "blur.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

The same filters in a single step look like this:

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -vf "crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih, boxblur=30" "blur.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

The video filters `-vf` are quoted in a single string, separated by commas, e.g.
`"filter1, filter2"`, which becomes `"crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih, boxblur=30"`.

The [`ffmpeg` filtering
introduction](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Filtering-Introduction)
explains this excellently:

> Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. 

Again, the `overlay` filter is more complicated, because it takes two inputs.
To apply this filter without any intermediate files, we have to `split` the
input stream into two streams:  (1) the cropped and blurred background `[bg]`
and (2) the scaled foreground `[fg]`.  The labels `[bg]` and `[fg]` are dummy
variables.  We can name them anything we want using the `[bracket]` syntax,
unlike the named constants such as `ih` or `main_h`.

{% highlight shell %}
ffmpeg \
	-i "input.mp4" \
	-vf "split [fg][bg];
	[bg]        crop=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ih, boxblur=30 [bg];
	[fg]       scale=ceil(ih*9/16/2)*2:ceil(ih*9*9/16/16/2)*2 [fg];
	[bg][fg] overlay=y=main_h/2-overlay_h/2" \
	"output.mp4"
{% endhighlight %}

In two distinct linear chains, the background `[bg]` is cropped and blurred,
while the foreground `[fg]` is scaled.  Finally, foreground is layed over the
background.

Et voilà!  Here's what it looks like in action:
