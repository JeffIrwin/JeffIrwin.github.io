# Abstract interfaces: setting fractal iterator functions at runtime in Fortran

2021 Dec 11

Fractal images are generated by calling an *iterator function* many times on the 2D coordinates *c* for each pixel in the image.  Colors in the image are assigned depending on how many iterations it takes for a point to *escape* beyond a certain beyond a certain radius, if it escapes at all.

Two common fractals are the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and the [burning ship fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal).

The only difference between these fractals is the iterator function.  For the Mandelbrot set, the iterator function is:
