# Injecting date and time into a GitHub page with Jekyll

It's a problem we've all faced.  You make an earth shattering edit to your blog on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"}, commit, push, and refresh your browser to see the changes.  But wait: are you looking at the edited page, or the old version?  You watch the page build [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions){:target="blank"} to confirm that it completed, but has the deployment trickled all the way down yet?

The only way to really know which version you're looking at is to add the build time or git revision somewhere on your page.  Jekyll even offers the `site.github.build_revision` [for the latter](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md){:target="blank"}.  We're going to look at a more flexible solution that can be extended to other automated page modifications.

## Setup your template page source with variables to be replaced

In my example, I'm working on the `_layouts/default.html` page.  You can run the injection on index.md or any other html or markdown translation unit.

We don't want the injection to modify our source code and we don't care about version control on the output of the injection process.  So, move your source to a template that will be the source of truth:

    mv _layouts/default.html _layouts/default-template.html

Next, [add the content](https://github.com/JeffIrwin/JeffIrwin.github.io/blob/4b9b3923903862b58c009129dee710111e2a21e7/_layouts/default-template.html#L94){:target="blank"} where you're going to inject variables:

    <p>Build: BUILD_DATE, revision: <code>BUILD_REVI</code></p>

The variable identifiers are `BUILD_DATE` and `BUILD_REVI`.
